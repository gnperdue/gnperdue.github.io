Born in Austin, TX, I live in the Chicago suburbs and work for the
[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](http://www.fnal.gov) as a physicist in
the [Fermi Quantum Institute](https://qis.fnal.gov). I am a Scientist working
on quantum computing and machine learning. I have a long history in
neutrino physics also, having spent much of the last decade working on the
[MINERvA Experiment](https://minerva.fnal.gov) and on the
[GENIE neutrino event generator](http://www.genie-mc.org).

I enjoy physics, programming, reading, and coffee.
