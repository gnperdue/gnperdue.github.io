Okay, so nominally this is a "yak-shaving" log, at least for the most part.
So. I don't feel right leaving up some of the criminally old posts here.
Anyone who happened upon them and decided to follow their advice would be in
for a world of trouble. For example, don't set up Scientific Python by
building a bunch of stuff from source! Instead, just use
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

If anyone really wants to see those old posts for some reason, it is pretty
easy to reverse engineer the GitHub repo that is the backend for this "blog"
and dig through the history there.
